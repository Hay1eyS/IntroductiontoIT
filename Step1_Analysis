Background: Smart Parking Barrier System.
A local university wants to implement a smart parking barrier system at its main gate. The
system should:
- Automatically open the barrier for registered staff and students.
- Count the number of cars in the parking lot.
- Display the number of available spots.
- Trigger an alert if someone tries to enter when the parking is full.
The goal is to simulate and implement the logic using the Integrated Problem-Solving Process.
Step 1: Understand and Define the Problem (Analyse)
Step 2: Organise and Describe the Data
Step 3: Plan the Solution (Design the Algorithm)
Step 4: Implement the Solution (Word Coding)
Step 5: Test and Refine the Solution (Debug and Verify)
